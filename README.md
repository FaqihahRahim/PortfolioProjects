Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset has information of orders made at Olist Store from 2016 to 2018. I analyzed 97K+ orders from the Olist public dataset to understand the delivery performance and fulfillment efficiency across the supply chain. 
I selected only the tables relevant to my experiance, focusing on order processing efficiency, fulfillment reliability, and delivery performance. I intentionally excluded product-level tables to keep the analysis aligned with operational KPIs. 

1. olist_order_items_dataset
2. olist_orders_dataset
3. olist_order_payments_dataset
4. olist_customers_dataset

Built using:
Excel | Power Query | Pivot Tables

This project shows how data can support better order processing and logistics planning.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in: 

✔ Data cleaning & modeling (Orders, Payments, Items, Customer) using Power Query

✔ Data Modelling using Power Pivot 

✔ Data Analysis using Excel

Part A: Data Cleaning
------------------------------------------------------------------

I cleaned the messy data using Power Query. The cleaning process involved handling missing values by removing them, standardizing formats, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, merge table and addressing any other data quality issues. As a result, the cleaned table provides a solid foundation for conducting meaningful analysis and valuable insights from the dataset.

Part B: Data Modelling 
----------------------------------------------

I learned Power Pivot and built a relational data model where i link disparate tables (e.g., orders, customers, payment, items) using common fields (primary key).

Conclusion
--------------------------

📈Olist overall revenue had a consistent rise throughout the years but peaked demand in November 2018 (especially during the Black Friday week)

⏱️Indication shows in strong delivery performance in Apr – Aug because delivery time is lower than average delivery: shorter delivery time, high delivery rate = faster fulfillment = better operational performance

⚠️Delivery slowed in Feb, Nov–Dec, indicating seasonal capacity constraints (Black Friday, Chrismas, Holiday periods)

✅The order cancelation rate on Olist is 0.63% (Less than 1%) which is a good indicator that there is a high level of customer satisfaction and efficiency.  This shows that customers are receiving products that they ordered, and there are minimal issues with the entire purchase process.
